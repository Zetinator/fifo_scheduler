# fifo_scheduler
This is an implementation of a **fifo_scheduler** using the **threading** module in `python3`.

## Usage
Modify the list of processes in `./src/inputs.txt` adding the processes to be simulated in the next format: `<name_of_the_process>, <number_of_pc_bursts>`

Then open a terminal on the root folder (where this `README.md` file is) and execute the following:

```bash
python3 ./src/scheduler_fcfs.py
```
